# Dodge-Wreck-Game
My very first game using Unity and C#

• Used Unity for entire game rendering and build settings
• Displayed Start, Level-up and End Game screens through Animations
• Applied forward force, sideways force and key functions through C#
• Added Start and Quit buttons and enforced their functionality through C#
